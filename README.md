# Birb extension
A simple extension that replaces the ugly X logo with the modern twitter bird logo. Also fixes and replace the "/X" with "/Twitter" in the tab title.

## To-do:
- [x] Replace the X with blue bird on top left corner
- [x] Replace the "/X" with "/Twitter"
- [x] Get rid of the "Premium" section lol
- [ ] Set a flag to turn on/off the Premium nav section hiding
- [x] Make an exception for "Lights Out" theme and add the black and white bird instead of the blue bird (HELP HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO FIND THAT OUT 😭💀) (it was pretty easy to find this out lol)

## Optionals:-
- [ ] Custom "CSS" injection
- [ ] Custom "Logo" injection
